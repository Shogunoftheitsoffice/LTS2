Based on LTS @ https://github.com/Shogunoftheitsoffice/LTS <br>
Yearly update 1. Hopefully dont have to work on this much after this. <br>
Lots of cool new features this time around and its going to take a bit longer but I think they will like it.

Checklist of some sort needed:
History of each item so we know how many times it has been checked out. Still need to decide where this should go.<br>
Maybe a combined history in stats including a tier list.<br>
Feedback Portal that actually does something. Like sending to me on teams.<br>
a cool logo.<br>
Multi item checkout using select and the checkout button.
